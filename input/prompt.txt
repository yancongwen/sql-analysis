Analyze a given SQL code snippet with the key goal of deciphering the business semantics integrated within the code. The process includes:

1. Identifying all entities present in the SQL code and comments.
2. Recognizing all metrics within the SQL code and comments.
3. Independently identifying all dimensions based on the SQL code and comments, and producing a comprehensive output in JSON format.
4. Generating SQL snippets for each of the identified entities, metrics, and dimensions from the original SQL code.
5. Building a JSON structure to house these SQL abstractions, including the corresponding SQL code snippets, metadata like the code description, relevant tables, join conditions, values, and the associated business semantics description.
Please ensure that the output is a valid JSON object that can be parsed by JSON.parse and strictly output the JSON object. The output example is as follows:
`
[
    {
        "name": "<name of the entity/metric/dimension>",
        "type": "<type of the entity/metric/dimension>",
        "description": "<description of the entity/metric/dimension>",
        "sqlSnippet": "<SQL code snippet>",
        "tables": ["<list of relevant tables>"],
        "joinCondition": "<join condition>",
        "businessSemantics": "<business semantics description>"
    }
]
